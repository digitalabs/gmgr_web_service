  ##Genealogy Manager Web Service##
		
  **OVERVIEW**
  
  The Genealogy Manager (**_GMGR_**) application accesses the Integrated Breeding Program Databases 
  (_IBP_) through the Middleware API, which consists of managers corresponding to 
  different systems. In order to reuse the methods of the IBP middleware, RESTful
  web services in java were created using the Jersey toolkit, an open source framework
  for developing RESTful Web Services in Java. 
  
  In a Representational State Transfer (_REST_) architechtural style, data and functionality are 
  considered resources, and these resources are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (_URIs_), 
  typically links on the web.
  
  You can learn more about the Jersey RESTful Web Services in Java **[here](https://jersey.java.net/). **
